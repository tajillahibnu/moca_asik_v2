# Database Configuration
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
# For SQLite, DB_DATABASE is the path to the sqlite file.
# We can use a relative path from the *server* directory or absolute path.
# Let's try absolute path or relative to server root which artisan serve understands.
# If running strict php artisan serve, it usually looks in database/database.sqlite by default if not set.
# But here we want to allow override.
DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite
